          My birth parents were addicts/abusive and I was in and out of foster
          care. Cue miscellaneous trauma. Come high school it was time to decide
          to go to college or not and I was told by teachers and councilors to
          try community college as my grades weren’t the best. No one recognized
          that I needed to go to university because once I graduated high
          school, I was out of the foster care system and had no where to live.
          I went to state school for 2 years amassing 30k in debt, dropped out,
          and started working full time.
        </p>
        <p class="Mow-entryCopy">
          I’m “one of the lucky ones” because I worked my way up into management
          and was making six figures. My boyfriend (now husband) is a unioned
          electrician with no student loans debt. My boyfriend and I got a house
          (for 30k in forclosure in 2012, had it paid off by 2017), got married,
          I paid off my student loans in full, and had two babies. I couldn’t
          continue working 10+ hour days and be away from my kids that long.
          Also even with my salary, daycare for 2 kids would mean I was bringing
          home only 1/3 of my check all to only get to spend MAYBE an hr a day
          with my kids. It wasn’t worth it so I left to stay home with them.
        </p>
        <p class="Mow-entryCopy">
          We’ve now outgrown our home and are ready to buy a new one, even with
          a pre approval letter, we’re losing all the houses we’re interested in
          to all cash offers. Our saving grace right now is that we’re mortgage
          free and will be able to sell the home for 5x what we paid for it.
          We’re considering moving into our MILS basement (two toddlers, two
          adults, and a dog) so that we can sell our home and potentially
          compete with these cash offers.
        </p>
        <p class="Mow-entryCopy">
          I feel like despite the shitty hand I was dealt, I did everything
          right. I overcame my personal traumas and what was expected of foster
          kids. I got the good job, worked the long hours to earn a good salary.
          Bought a house, lived below our means to get it paid off. Paid off my
          loans like I was supposed to. And still, I’m now jobless with two
          small kids, considering moving into my MIL basement. I genuinely don’t
          understand how people are supposed to succeed.
